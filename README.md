# Introduction
This repository contains my bioinformatic analysis code samples for graduate school applications. 

edgeR_analysis.R, time_course_heatmap.R, and enrichment_heatmap.R were used in the analysis of RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data for the SARS-CoV-2 translation regulation project (doi: https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00815-22).


# Script Descriptions:

edgeR_analysis.R: 
Conduct differential gene expression (DGE) analysis using edgeR.

time_course_heatmap.R:
Using counts and DGE analysis results, cluster genes by time-course expression patterns and create a heatmap of the clusters.

enrichment_heatmap.R:
Conduct gene set over-representation analysis for gene clusters from the time course heatmap.
